A CFD-based process simulation model was created to analyze metal 3D printing, specifically Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM). This process is split into two phases: metal transfer and molten pool dynamics. In the metal transfer phase, the model calculates the point at which molten metal droplets fall by balancing the forces causing droplet detachment against surface tension. The second phase involves analyzing molten pool dynamics, influenced by five factors: buoyancy, Marangoni effect, droplet momentum, viscous drag, and electromagnetic forces. These factors are modeled using thermophysical properties and enhanced through custom subroutines for extended physical modeling. The simulation results are then validated against data from actual WAAM coupons.
